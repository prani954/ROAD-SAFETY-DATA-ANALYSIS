# ROAD SAFETY DATA ANALYSIS
- Exploratory Data Analysis and Visualization provides critical insights into the dataset by identifying patterns, relationships, and anomalies. Using various plots and statistical summaries, EDA helps in understanding the underlying structure of the data and guides informed decision-making for improving road safety measures.

**Number of Vehicles and Number of Casualties**
A scatter plot visualized the relationship between the number of vehicles involved in an accident and the resulting casualties. This helps identify if accidents with more vehicles tend to have more casualties.

**Casualties and Speed Limit**
A scatter plot explored the impact of speed limits on casualties, differentiating between urban and rural areas. This helps understand how speed limits affect accident severity in different environments and may highlight areas for stricter speed enforcement.

**Descriptive Statistics**
Summary statistics, including mean and median, were computed for key attributes like the number of vehicles and casualties. This provides a numerical overview of typical values and variability within the dataset.

## Distribution Plots
Various distribution plots were created to visualize key attributes:

- Accident Severity: A distribution plot with a kernel density estimate (KDE) shows the frequency of different accident severities, highlighting the commonality of severe accidents.
- Number of Vehicles and Casualties: Histograms illustrate the distribution of vehicles involved and resulting casualties, providing insights into common accident scenarios.

## Accident Severity by Day of the Week
A plot shows accident severity across different days, helping identify if severe accidents are more likely on certain days, which can inform traffic safety measures.

## Accident Severity by Road Type
A KDE plot visualized the distribution of accident severity across road types, helping understand how road type influences accident severity and informing road safety planning.

## Accident Severity by First Road Number
A plot examined the relationship between accident severity and the first road number involved, revealing if certain roads are more prone to severe accidents and informing targeted interventions.

## Light Conditions Analysis
Light conditions were categorized and counted to analyze their impact on accidents. The analysis revealed whether accidents are more likely in daylight or various darkness conditions, providing insights for improving lighting.

## Weather Conditions Analysis
Weather conditions were categorized and counted to understand their impact on accidents. The analysis identified which weather conditions are associated with more accidents, informing weather-specific road safety measures.

## Road Surface Conditions Analysis
Road surface conditions were categorized and counted to analyze their effect on accidents. This identified which conditions (e.g., wet, icy, dry) are more prone to accidents, highlighting the importance of road maintenance and specific measures during adverse weather.
